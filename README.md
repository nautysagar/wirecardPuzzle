Solution: If we choose box 1 or 2, we may be in trouble. For example, suppose we choose box 1 (the box labeled “apples”) and we see an orange – then we won’t know if that box contains only oranges or a mix of apples and oranges. We face a similar dilemma if you choose box 2 (the box labeled “oranges”) and you see an apple.

So, if the fruit removed from box 3 is an apple, then the correct labeling is as follows:

Box 1: “oranges”
Box 2: “apples & oranges”
Box 3: “apples”
